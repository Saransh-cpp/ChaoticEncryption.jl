    substitution_encryption(image, keys; path_for_result="./encrypted.png")

Performs substitution encryption on a given image with the given keys.

# Algorithm
Iterates simulataneously over each pixel and key, and XORs the pixel value
(all R, G, and B) with the given key. Hence, the order of the keys matter.

# Arguments
- `image::Array{RGB{N0f8},2}`: A loaded image.
- `keys::Array{Int64, 1}`: Keys for encryption.
- `path_for_result::String`: The path for storing the encrypted image.

# Returns
- `encryptedImage::Array{RGB{N0f8}, 2}`: Encrypted image.

# Example
```jldoctest
julia> using TestImages, ChaoticEncryption

julia> img = testimage("mandrill")

"""
    substitution_decryption(image, keys; path_for_result="./decrypted.png")

Performs substitution decryption on a given image with the given keys.

# Algorithm
Iterates simulataneously over each pixel and key, and XORs the pixel value
(all R, G, and B) with the given key. Hence, the keys provided must be the same
as the ones provided during encryption.

# Arguments
- `image`: `::String` or `::Array{RGB{N0f8},2}`. The path to the image or the loaded image to be decrypted.
- `keys::Array{Int64, 1}`: Keys for decryption.
- `path_for_result::String`: The path for storing the decrypted image.

# Returns
- `decryptedImage::Array{RGB{N0f8}, 2}`: Decrypted image.
